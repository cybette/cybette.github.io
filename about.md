Engineer by training, communicator by profession, musician by passion. Currently enpowering open source communities at Red Hat. Previously Jolla community chief, Nokia software engineer. Organizing, participating (and occasionally speaking) at FOSS events around the world. Percussionist with TASO.fi in those few offline moments. Cool gadgets and timpani sticks are my Achilles heel.
