## Other Blogs

Before switching careers to more communications / community-facing roles, I was an engineer for the longest time and did not blog for work. Thus the earlier writings were mainly in my personal blogs. However I did have a stint with the Nokia S60 Blog, as well as volunteering for MeeGo community Finland.
